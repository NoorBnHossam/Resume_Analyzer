# Resume Analyzer

This **Resume Analyzer** project was developed in our second year at **Delta University, Faculty of Artificial Intelligence**. The project automates resume screening to assist job seekers in optimizing their resumes and improve their chances of passing through automated hiring systems used by many companies.

## Project Overview
The Resume Analyzer uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to assess resumes for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compliance, helping candidates avoid common errors and include relevant keywords. It also provides personalized feedback, offering job recommendations based on skills and experience extracted from resumes.

## Key Features
- **Error Detection & ATS Compliance**: Highlights formatting errors, missing keywords, and structural issues to help resumes pass ATS filters.
- **Personalized Job Suggestions**: Analyzes candidates' skills and experiences to suggest suitable job roles.
- **Improvement Tips**: Provides specific feedback on resume sections needing enhancement for better marketability.

## Usage
Candidates can upload their resumes and receive real-time feedback on ATS optimization, as well as targeted job recommendations. This tool serves both job seekers looking to improve their resumes and companies wanting to streamline their candidate screening process.
